= Verified faucet

== Intro

A faucet to issue tokens to SMS or email verified accounts.


== Requirements

It requires running a Parity node on a chain with registrar and verification contracts.

== Config

Yep, you must do a bit of config! But that´s easy, hang on tight.

Config is done in `config.js` :

- RPC endpoint 
- the faucet address
- number of tokens to send to SMS/email verified address
- minimum time between claims

== Run

First make sure your nodes are running. You´ll need to run both kovan and mainnet with something like:

	parity --unlock "<YourFaucet>" --password faucet.txt --jsonrpc-port 8546 --chain kovan.json
	parity --json-rpc 8545

Then start the faucet

	pm2 start sms-faucet.json
